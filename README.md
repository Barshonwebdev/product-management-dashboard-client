Simple Product Management dashboard using MERN

Introduction
This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for setting up, using, and testing the Product Management Dashboard app. This app is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Vite for frontend development. The dashboard allows users to add, delete, update, and view products, as well as handle payments using Stripe.

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB (local or cloud-based)
vite react

Testing
Unit Tests
Unit tests are written using Jest and can be found in the server/tests and client/tests directories.

Run backend unit tests:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm run test


Run frontend unit tests:

bash
Copy code
cd ../client
npm run test
Integration Tests
Integration tests ensure that different parts of the application work together as expected. They can also be found in the server/tests and client/tests directories.

Run backend integration tests:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm run test:integration


Run frontend integration tests:

bash
Copy code
cd ../client
npm run test:integration
End-to-End Tests
End-to-end tests simulate user interactions with the application. These tests are typically written using tools like Cypress.

Install Cypress (if not already installed):

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install cypress
Run Cypress tests:

bash
Copy code
npm run cypress:open
This command will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can run end-to-end tests.


Starting the Frontend
Navigate to the client directory:

bash
Copy code
cd client


Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
